This assignment consists of designing and building a set of programs to simulate a building entry 
controller system and provide a testing harness. The system is similar to that discussed during the 
lectures â€“ a two door system with card scanners on each door, a scale that weighs the person after 
they have entered the space between the two doors, and a human guard that uses a switch to open 
each of the doors.
